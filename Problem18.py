#18.Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red,white, and blue.we will use th integers 0,1 and 2 to represent the color red,white and blue.You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
def sortColors(nums):
    low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1

    while mid <= high:
        if nums[mid] == 0:
            nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1

        elif nums[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1

        else:  # nums[mid] == 2
            nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
            high -= 1
